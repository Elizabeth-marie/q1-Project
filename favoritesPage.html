        <!-- <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. It all happens automatically. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. Anyone can paint. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy.

Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. In this world, everything can be happy. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. You can spend all day playing with mountains. Here's another little happy bush Brown is such a nice color. Now then, let's play.

Let's build some happy little clouds up here. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. Fluff that up.

It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. You're meant to have fun in life. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. We can fix anything. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so.</p> -->
